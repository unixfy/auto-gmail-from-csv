# auto-gmail-from-csv

Automatically sends emails using your gmail account taking some data from CSV, created for a school project
(in this case the use case was to automatically blast emails out for a research project involving a survey)
More or less, this one is a poor man's mail merge for Gmail, if using Outlook is not possible. (Outlook is probably still easier than this)
